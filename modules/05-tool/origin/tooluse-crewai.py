# A basic logging setup helps in debugging and tracking the crew's execution.

# --- Set up your API Key ---
# For production, use a secure method for key management, such as environment
# variables loaded at runtime or a secret manager.
#
# Set the environment variable for your chosen LLM provider (for example,
# OPENAI_API_KEY).
